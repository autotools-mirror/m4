GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro
processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters
to macros).  `m4' also has built-in functions for including files,
running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU
`m4' for generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

GNU `m4' has been originally written by René Seindal, from Denmark.

GNU `m4' has a web site at http://www.seindal.dk/rene/gnu/.

If GNU `m4' is meant to serve GNU `autoconf', beware that `m4'
should be fully installed *prior to* configuring `autoconf' itself.

In the subdirectories `tests' and `examples' you will find various m4
files, ranging from trivial test files to rather advanced macros.  If
you intend to use m4 seriously, you might find useful material down
there.

By using `./configure --with-gmp, you get multiple precision integral
and rational arithmetic using mpeval.  The implementation depends on the
GNU gmp v2 library.

By using `./configure --with-modules, you get the possibility of using
dynamic modules.  The implementation depends on dlopen(3) interface.
See file `modules/README' for a more detailed description.

By using `./configure --enable-changeword', you get an experimental
feature which allows for changing the syntax of what is a "word" in
`m4'.  THIS WILL PROBABLY GO AWAY, so don't count on it.  Some of the
same things can be achieved with `changesyntax' at a much better speed.

By using `./configure --with-dmalloc', GNU m4 is linked with Gray
Watson's dmalloc package.  It is a debugging option for finding memory
management problems.  Gray Watson's dmalloc package is available at
ftp://ftp.letters.com/src/dmalloc/dmalloc.tar.gz.

Send bug reports, comments or ideas to `bug-m4@gnu.org'.  A bug report
is an adequate description of the problem: your input, what you
expected, what you got, and why this is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but
they only describe a solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to
infer.  Don't forget all relevant information about your operating
system, compiler, libraries, ...
