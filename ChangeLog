	Ansify the source.  Previously we had a mix, where my code was
	in a K&R compatible style, and the preexisting code was in ANSI
	style.  Nothing is lost wrt release 1.4 by reverting to ANSI,
	and now the code base is much cleaner.

	* m4/system.h:  Remove M4_PARAMS macro and all users.  Remove
	VOID macro and all users.

	* m4/utility.c (m4_numeric_arg): Spell out the culprit.
	* modules/m4.c (undivert): Disable the possibility of undiverting
	several files at once: it is not documented, it is inconsistent
	with the other macros, it can be straightforwardly mocked by
	several invocations, and most importantly, it prevents the
	possibility of other kinds of extension.
	Use `m4_numeric_arg'.

2001-08-20  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* examples/include.m4: Typo.

	(include, undivert): Add -I examples/.

2001-08-20  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Use sprintf, not ecft and friends since it is standard, portable,
	simplifies the code, and since the latter is even deprecated
	according to the GNU libc documentation.

2001-08-19  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	And anyway, proper quotation is enough.
	(m4_pattern_allow): As it exists in 2.50, just use it.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Split in AC_CONFIG_FILES and AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS.
	Don't handle Gettext's duties, let it handle them.

	* m4/module.c: Reimplemented to take advantage of advances in

	(M4FINISH_HANDLER):  And similarly for finish functions.
	* m4/system.h (_CONC): Used by M4INIT_HANDLER and M4FINISH_HANDLER

	correctly expanded.
	* modules/modtest.c (m4_init_module):  Replaced with M4INIT_HANDLER.
	* modules/shadow.c (m4_init_module):  Ditto.

	module association does not belong with the symbol...
	* m4/input.c (struct m4_builtin): ...it belongs with the builtin
	that the module implementation code is from.  Added a handle
	field.
	(m4_push_macro): Add a `handle' argument.  Changed all callers.

	and shipped version based on configure tests.
	* src/freeze.c (obstack.h): Ditto.

	(AC_ARG_PROGRAM): Remove, handled by Automake.
	(m4_getopt): Rename as...
	(m4_getopt_h): this.
	Allow the tokens `m4_cv_*', `m4_top_srcdir', and `m4_getopt_h'.
	Undefine `changeword' only if defined.
	* config/gnu-obstack.m4: Require Autoconf 2.52.

2000-11-29  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	examples/wrap.test, modules/frozen.m4, modules/modfreeze.test,
	modules/modpath1.test, modules/modpath2.test,
	modules/modpath3.test, modules/modpath4.test,
	modules/modtest.test, modules/shadow.test,
	modules/unfrozen.m4, modules/unload.test: Removed.

	Move the implementation of GMP support for the mpeval() builtin
	into a loadable module that depends on libgmp.  mpeval() and
	eval() share a common parser, now in m4/evalparser.c; the code
	in m4/numb.c and m4/numb.h is now physically split between
	m4/eval.c (the eval() backend) and modules/mpeval.c (the
	mpeval() backend), rather than being differentiated by cpp
	macros and multiple inclusion.  The mpeval module is always
	built but will generate an diagnostic if it is used from an
	installation that didn't link in the gmp library.
	* modules/Makefile.am: build and install the new mpeval module.
	* modules/mpeval.c: Now contains the former parts of m4/numb.c
	and m4/numb.h that are required for gmp support in mpeval().
	* m4/Makefile.am (libm4_la_SOURCES): Removed evalmp.c.
	* m4/evalmp.c:  Removed.
	* m4/m4module.h: Removed conditional prototype for
	m4_mp_evaluate().
	* m4/eval.c: Rewritten.  Contains the former parts of m4/numb.c
	and m4/numb.h that do not rely on gmp.
	* m4/evalparse.c:  New file, contains the shared parts of the
	eval() and evalmp() parser implementations, and is no longer
	unencumbered by cpp magic to uncover the right parts.
	* m4/numb.h:  Removed.  It's former contents are split between
	m4/eval.c and modules/mpeval.c.
	* m4/numb.c: ditto.

	* tests/other-tests/changeword.test: New test.  Rudimentary
	testing of changeword builtin runs only if --wnable-changeword
	was used at configure time.
	* tests/mkconfig.sh: Solaris sed (at least) does not parse nested
	alternation correctly.  Split into two expressions to compensate.
	* m4/input.c (m4_input_init): Use m4_ prefix on m4_set_word_regexp.
	* modules/Makefile.am: Build changeword module.
	* modules/changeword.c (m4_macro_table): Define __m4_changeword__
	only when --enable-changeword was passed to configure.
	(builtin_changeword): If --enable-changeword was not used, then
	report that changeword() builtin has no support in m4 binary.

2000-11-28  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* src/main.c (main): Fixed a particularly nasty bug is
	user_search_path setting -- the -M flag processing must be
	extremely careful with search path ordering, or else the default
	installed module directory (possibly containing modules from a
	previous release) is placed earlier in the search path than any -M
	arguments (which are relied upon to load uninstalled modules with
	most of the tests in the regresion suite).

	* modules/load.c (builtin_load):  Nasty hack to prevent adding
	symbols to symtab again if a module is loaded more than once.
	* modules/m4.c (builtin_ifelse): removed unused variable argv0.

	* m4/symtab.c (m4_remove_table_reference_symbols):  Fixed a
	possible NULL pointer dereference.

	* m4/module.c (m4_module_find_by_modname): Renamed from
	m4_module_modname_find.   Fixed all references.
	(m4_module_find_by_builtin):  New function.

	* modules/modfreeze.test: load the `load' module with each
	invocation.
	* src/freeze.c (produce_frozen_state): Simplified in light of
	module field in m4_symbol.  Allow a third argument for text macros
	to name the originating module.
	(reload_frozen_state): ditto.
	* m4/m4module.h:  Fixup prototypes.
	* m4/builtin.h (m4_builtin_define): Add a module argument so
	that symbols can be registered against the defining module.
	(m4_macro_define): ditto.
	* m4/m4private.h (m4_symbol): Make the module field const to save
	on casting in the rest of the code.
	(SYMBOL_MODULE): New macro.

	* m4/symtab.c (m4_remove_table_reference_symbols): Fixed stupid
	symbol reference maintenance bugs when removing a symbol from the
	symtab.

	* src/stackovf.c (setup_stackovf_trap): Fixed some memory leaks.

2000-11-27  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* configure.in (m4_cv_func_obstack): A better check for whether
	libc has an obstack implementation.
	* m4/Makefile.am (EXTRA_libm4_la_SOURCES): add gnu-obstack.h.

	* configure.in (--with-modules): Changed semantics.  This
	option is now used to list modules to be preopened.
	* src/m4.h: #include "ltdl.h" unconditionally.
	* src/main.c: Removed all dependencies on WITH_MODULES.
	* src/freeze.c: ditto.
	* modules/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* m4/m4.c (builtin_m4exit): ditto.
	* modules/modpath1.test: ditto.
	* modules/modpath2.test: ditto.
	* modules/modpath3.test: ditto.
	* modules/modpath4.test: ditto.
	* modules/modtest.test: ditto.
	* modules/shadow.test: ditto.
	* modules/unload.test: ditto.

	* m4/Makefile.am (libm4_la_SOURCES): Removed obstack.c, since it
	comes up on demand in LTLIBOBJS now.
	* configure.in (getopt_long):  Creating and relying on a link for
	getopt.h on hosts with no getopt_long() of thier own works
	correctly now.  This is necessary so that callers of getopt_long()
	can simply `#include <getopt.h>': the naive way of doing this
	would end up using our own getopt.h and the installed
	getopt_long(), which is asking for trouble!
	(obstack_init): A similar argument applies to obstack.h and
	obstack_init().

	* m4/ltdl.c: Upgraded to latest bleeding edge version again.
	On Solaris-2.5 (at least) the native dlopen implementation
	gets confused about m4.o when looking for module "m4".  This
	version always looks for .la an .$lib_ext suffixed names first
	to work around the problem.  Sigh.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Take account of these file movements.
	* src/Makefile.am (m4_SOURCES): removed eval.c.
	(EXTRA_m4_SOURCES): removed numb.c and numb.h.
	* m4/Makefile.am (libm4_la_SOURCES): added eval.c.
	(EXTRA_libm4_la_SOURCES): added numb.c and numb.h.
	* modules/m4.c (builtin_eval): Use m4_evaluate().
	* m4/eval.c: Moved here from src/eval.c to facilitate
	implementation of eval() builtin as part of the `m4' loadable
	module.
	(m4_evaluate): renamed from evaluate for namespace cleanliness.
	* m4/numb.c: Moved here from src/numb.c, since it is #included
	into eval.c at compile time.
	* m4/m4module.h (m4_evaluate): Added prototype.
	* src/m4.h (evaluate): Removed prototype.

2000-11-25  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* modules/perl.c (builtin_perleval):  Use PL_na for
	compatibility with perl-5.6.

	* src/main.c (main):  It is now safe to
	``m4_module_install("m4")'', without tripping over the m4
	binary itself!
	* m4/ltdl.h, m4/ltdl.c: Upgraded to latest bleeding edge
	versions having fixed the insidious module search order bug.

	* m4/Makefile.am (libm4_la_LIBADD): New magic -- we are
	supposed to be using @LIBADD_DL@; @DLLDFLAGS@ is dead.

	* configure.in: Figure out whether to use the installed
	getopt.h or the supplied one.
	* src/Makefile.am: ditto.

	* po/POTFILES.in: List files in their new positions.

	* config/ltmain.sh:  This needs to be checked in to match the
	libtool macros copied to acinclude.m4 (until a released
	libtool copes with m4's needs).
	* bootstrap:  Run gettextize.

	* src/ltdl.c: Use access() to abort doomed module load attempts
	if module file does not exist.

	* src/Makefile.am (m4_SOURCES, EXTRA_SOURCES): getopt.o and
	getopt1.o will already be used if appropriate, so I moved getopt.c
	and getopt1.c from m4_SOURCES to EXTRA_SOURCES.

	* modules/modpath1.test: Use correct filename in header line.
	* modules/modpath2.test: ditto.
	* modules/modpath3.test: ditto.
	* modules/modpath4.test: ditto.

	Without these changes lt_dlopen("test") attempts to
	LoadLibrary("/bin/test") on Windows, which although harmless
	generates a spurious error message which spoils most of the tests:
	* modules/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): s/test.m4 /modtest.m4 /
	(TESTS): s/test.test /modtest.test /
	(pkglibexec_LTLIBRARIES): s/test.la /modtest.la /
	(test_la_SOURCES, test_la_LDFLAGS): renamed to use modtest.
	* modules/modpath1.test: s/test.m4 /modtest.m4 /
	* modules/modpath2.test: ditto.
	* modules/modpath4.test: ditto.
	* modules/modpath3.test: s/-m test /-m modtest /
	* modules/shadow.m4: use {un,}loadmodule(`modtest').

2000-01-16  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* src/module.c (module_init): No longer static

	* modules/Makefile.am ({test,shadow,time,stdlib}_la_LDFLAGS):
	Added to shut up automake about non standard libtool library
	names.

	* doc/help2man.pl: updated to version 1.020.

	* lib/COPYING.LIB:  updated to version 2.1.

	* lib/m4module.h: restructure the M4_SCOPE code to work when
	creating a dll which links with libm4.la and both DLL_EXPORT
	(for the new dll) and LIBM4_DLL_IMPORT (for m4module.h) are
	both defined.

2000-01-11  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	Merged the following changes from my tree:

	1999-06-15  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* configure.in (AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL): Declare that m4 has been
	ported to compile shared libs.

	* configure.in (LIBM4_DLL_IMPORT): Discover whether we need to
	use `__declspec(dllimport)' when linking libm4.la on win32.
	* src/Makefile.am (m4_LDFLAGS): Use dllimport if necessary.

	* configure.in (M4OBJS): Discover whether we need the shipped
	implementation of getopt_long.
	* src/Makefile.am (m4_LDADD): Link the getopt objects into the
	main binary here, as opposed to the module library in lib/libm4.la.

	1999-06-14  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* modules/README: Updated to describe the improved libltdl based
	module scheme.
	* README (cygwin): Added some compilation notes for building m4
	correctly under cygwin.
	* TODO: Cleaned out the entries for the module system since they
	are now implemented.

	* *.[ch]: __P is in the compiler's reserved namespace, so replaced
	all instances of __P with M4_PARAMS.

	* lib/getdate.h: removed unreferenced file.

	* lib/m4private.h: New file to define the private interface to the
	token_data struct, which must be shared between m4module.c, and
	builtin.c but not exported to modules built from the installed
	m4module.h since it's size changes depending on compile time
	options.

	* src/m4.h: Lots of stuff moved to lib/m4module.h.

	* lib/m4module.h: New file to define the interface available when
	compiling m4 modules.
	* lib/m4module.c: Moved parts of builtin.c, and m4.c which are
	necessary for module compilation into this new file.

	* lib/Makefile.am (include_HEADERS): install headers (renamed to
	avoid nameclash with other system headers) necessary for compiling
	modules.
	(libm4_la_SOURCES): always include error.c, obstack.c and regex.c
	so that modules can include the (renamed) installed headers and
	be guaranteed a matching implementation.
	* lib/m4error.h: renamed from error.h.
	* lib/m4obstack.h: renamed from obstack.h.
	* lib/m4regex.h: renamed from regex.h.
	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS):  Don't look for a system
	implementation, simply include the shipped version
	unconditionally, otherwise it is hard for a module to know
	whether the m4obstack.h header it is using matches the
	implementation it ends up linking against.
	(jm_WITH_REGEX):  Include regex into libm4 unconditionally for
	the same reason.

	1999-05-18  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* examples/misc.test: Don't run this test on machines which don't
	have a root user in /etc/passwd (e.g. cygwin).

	* tests/get-them (/^@example$/): Error messages might have a
	``.exe'' suffix to the program name, or else use the libtool
	``.libs/lt-m4'' binary, or generally have an unexpected path.  All
	of these cases are now catered for when comparing error messages
	in generated tests.
	* tests/other-tests/*.test: ditto.
	* examples/*.test: ditto.

	* tests/defs (M4): use libtool execute mode.
	* examples/defs (M4): ditto.

	* tests/get-them (END): explicitly close any open file.
	(printthem): In a regular expression, '{' is the start of a repeat
	count!  Use `[{]' for a literal open brace.
	(/^@node /): Don't use substr on a string shorter than the trim
	length.

	1999-05-17  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* configure.in (LTLIBOBJS): calculated from LIBOBJS, and
	substituted.

	HAVE_SIGINFO_H.

2000-01-10  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* Prerelease 1.4o.

	* TODO, NEWS: Cleaned up and updated.

	* src/m4.c (main): New variable exit_status for exit status in
	case of unreadable files.  Now m4 will exit with EXIT_FAILURE if a
	file cannot be read instead of EXIT_SUCCESS.

	* src/builtin.c (m4_indir): Changed error message to help
	translators (from Akim Demaille <demaille@inf.enst.fr>).

	* lib/obstack.[hc], getopt*.[ch]: Updated to newest version from
	Cygnus.

	* lib/error.[hc], lib/regex.[hc], lib/strtol.c: Updated to version
	from glic 2.1.2.

	* src/input.c (match_input): Reordering of code, to avoid multiple
	calls to push_string_init() from obstack_grow(), which can happen
	with some compilers (found and fixed by James Bonfield
	<jkb@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk>).

	* src/stackovf.c: Added prototypes for ultrix.
	(setup_stackovf_trap): Added __P to cast.
	(Both reported by John David Anglin <dave@hiauly1.hia.nrc.ca>)

2000-01-09  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* doc/m4.texinfo (Changequote): Added comment about changing
	quotes when the old quote is a part of the new.

	* src/builtin.c (expand_ranges): Added break after trailing dash.
	This caused misbehavious on some systems (found and fixed by Akim
	Demaille <demaille@inf.enst.fr>).

	* AUTHORS: Thomas Tanner included

	* acconfig.h: Added entry for ss_sp (see below).

	* configure.in (use_stackovf): Added check for stack_t with member
	ss_base instead of ss_sp (BSDI notably).  (Reported by Paul Eggert
	<eggert@twinsun.com>).

1999-11-10  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): Passes -I acm4 to aclocal.

	* src/module.c: reindented.
	(module_load): return if this is a repeated load of same module.
	(module_init): slight change of logic to avoid repeated
	initialisation debug messages.

	* src/m4.h: Include error.h, since our macros use error.
	* src/m4.c: Don't need to include error.h.

1999-11-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/m4.h (voidstar): Define to void * if __STDC__ is defined
	and zero, as Solaris 7 cc does.
	(bcopy): Remove macro; no longer needed with new obstack.h.

	* src/output.c (freeze_diversions): Don't assume that a
	diversion size can fit in `int'.  Check for diversion file

	* src/Makefile.am (CFLAGS): Omit -Wall.

	* src/stackovf.c (setup_stackovf_trap): Remove cast to unsigned.

	* src/debug.c (trace_format):
	Use ANSI C if (defined __STDC__ && __STDC__) || defined PROTOTYPES.

	of modules.
	* src/m4.c (--load-module): dynamically load named runtime module
	into running executable before reading the source.
	(--module-directory): prepend a directory to the module search
	path.
	(module_init()): Do this the first time we load a module instead;
	if the module subsystem is broken normal m4 scripts can still run.
	* src/m4.h (install_builtin_table): is now exported.

1999-03-26  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	better.
	* acm4/Makefile.am (ACINCLUDE_M4): ditto.
	* acm4/gettext.m4: removed.  It causes a multiple definition vs.
	the installed gettext.m4 file when running aclocal.

1999-03-25  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* configure.in (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): bumped version number to
	distinguish this from the last prerelease.
	(AC_LIBLTDL_CONVENIENCE):  build libltdl as a convenience library
	in its own subdirectory.

	* modules/Makefile.am (*_SOURCES): renamed to use libtool's "no
	lib prefix on a module" feature.
	(LDFLAGS): Added `-module -avoid-version' flags to build
	versionless module libraries.
	* src/builtin.c (m4_load_module): use libltdl.
	(module_unload_all): use libltdl.
	* src/m4.c (module_init): initialise module loading on demand for
	better diagnostics, and so that m4 will still work even if
	the module code is broken.
	* src/m4.h (module_init): removed.  No longer relevant.
	* modules/stdlib.c (m4_macro_table): use stdlib_LTX_ prefix on

1998-12-01  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@issan.cs.uni-dortmund.de>

	* src/module.c (module_try_load): Don't try to be clever and
	overwrite argument string.  Instead allocate all constructed
	strings locally, since they can have arbitrary lengths.  Make
	arguments pointers to const.
	(module_search): Simplify due to above change.

1998-11-29  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* Prerelease 1.4n.

	and mpeval.

1998-11-28  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* src/m4.c (main): New option --import-environment (no single
	letter option).

	* When configured with --with-gmp both the normal (fast) eval()
	and the gmp aware mpeval() are defined.  To restore previous
	bahaviour use "define(`eval', defn(`mpeval'))".

	* tests/other-tests/gmp.m4: Changed to use mpeval().

	* src/evalmp.c: New file for compiling eval.c as gmp aware.
	Just defines USE_GMP if WITH_GMP is defined and includes eval.c.

	* src/eval.c: Now includes "numb.c" directly.  Everything in this
	file must by static, except evaluate(), which is changed to
	mp_evaluate() if USE_GMP in force.

	* src/numb.c: Changed to be included by eval.c instead of being
	compiled separately.  Everything is declared static.

	* src/m4.c (main): m4 --version also shows which options were used
	for compilation, such as: "GNU m4 1.4n (options: modules gmp)"

1998-11-27  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* Error messages now always print program name before input file
	name as specified by GNU coding standards.  Reported by Akim
	Demaille <demaille@inf.enst.fr>.

	* doc/m4.texinfo (Include): Change due to changed error message
	format.
	(Eval): Do.

	* tests/get-them: Minor change to sed script due to changed error
	message format.

	* src/m4.c (print_program_name): New func used to print program
	name, input file and line number in error ().  Used as an
	error_print_progname handler.
	(reference_error): Removed.
	(main): Assigns error_print_progname.

	* src/m4.h (M4ERROR): Removed reference_error ().

1998-11-25  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* Updated to libtool 1.2b.

	* src/builtin.c (install_builtin_table): Added braces to avoid
	warning of ambiguous 'else'.

	* src/module.c: Inserted search path code from path.c modified to
	use new interface.
	(module_init): Configured default path used only if M4MODPATH is
	not set.
	(module_try_load): Now reads libMODULE.la as generated by libtool
	for actual module name.
	(module_load): Gives better error messages on failure.

	* src/m4.h: Added declarations of structures and functions for
	generic search path handling.

	* src/path.c: Removed all module specific code and introduced new
	functions of more generic search path handling.

1998-11-24  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* configure.in: Defines INTLINCL to -I$(top_srcdir)/intl if using
	included gettext, as <libintl.h> might not be found
	otherwise. Reported by Andrew Bettison <andrewb@zip.com.au>.

1998-11-22  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* src/output.c (insert_diversion): Fixed bug that might cause m4
	to read from standard output!  Triggered by input
	'divert(1)undivert(0)'.  Test for divnum>0 changed to divnum>=0,
	so now 'undivert(0)' does nothing.

1998-11-18  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* Prerelease 1.4m.

	* src/input.c (set_word_regexp): Fixed a bug, where word_regexp

	standards.

	* src/m4.c (usage): Added message about reporting bugs.

	* doc/m4.texinfo (Changeword): Corrected a wrong example.

	and AM_PROG_LIBTOOL.

	* acm4/modules.m4 (AM_WITH_MODULES): Redone completely to work
	with libtool.

	* modules/Makefile.am: Changed completely to compile modules using
	libtool.  The modules are compiled as shared libraries, and are
	renamed when installed.

	* src/m4.h, src/module.c, acm4/modules.m4, acconfig.h: Renamed
	USE_SHL_LOAD to HAVE_SHL_LOAD

	* src/builtin.c (shipout_string): Now tests for a NULL string.

	* src/module.c: New level of indirection around non-portable
	functions to load shared objects.  Intended to encapsulate the non
	portable parts better and to reduce the number of #ifdefs in the
	code.

	* Makefile.am (DIST_SUBDIRS): Instead of EXTRA_DIST for added
	directory modules/ to the distribution.

1998-11-15  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* Prerelease 1.4l.

	* modules/stdlib.c: New module `stdlib' defining some standard
	functions: getcwd, getlogin, getpid, getppid, getuid, getpwnam,

	* modules/Makefile.am: Now correctly compiles and installs
	modules in pkglibexecdir.

	These two are now initialised by autoconf macros.

	* src/path.c (module_env_init): MODULE_PATH is always on the
	search path.

	* src/Makefile.am: Now generated pathconf.h which defined the
	default MODULE_PATH.

	* configure.in (pkglibexecdir): Added defintion of pkglibexecdir,
	where modules are installed.

	* acm4/modules.m4: Enhanced with code from MetaHTML, contributed
	by Brian J. Fox <bfox@datawave.net>.  This change allow modules to
	build and install automatically, and it is prepared for other
	interfacec than dlopen().

	* src/builtin.c (predefined_tab): Added __m4_version__ for the
	current version of GNU m4.  It is a GNU extension.

1998-11-14  Rene' Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* tests/Makefile.am (GENERATED_TESTS): Added new
	generated-tests/changesy.8.test

	* tests/Makefile.am (GENERATED_TESTS): Renamed gentest to
	generated-tests.

	* tests/Makefile.am (OTHER_TESTS, OTHER_FILES): Added manually
	maintained tests in tests/other-tests.  These currently tests for
	8-bit transparency, multiple precision arithmetic and sync-line
	output.  Test for stackoverflow detection does not work.

	* examples/Makefile.am (TESTS): Added tests for all example files.

	* examples/mktests.sh: New file.  Help program for creating test
	files.

	* tests/mkconfig.sh: New file to generate tests/config.m4 and
	tests/config.sh.  This is for tests of configure selectable
	features.  Picks up all set WITH_ and ENABLE_ veriables from

	.test, as the files are no longer just m4 input.

	* tests/get-them (FILE): Changed .m4 extension to .test.

	* src/m4.h (token_type): New token type TOKEN_SPACE introduced.
	Otherwise quoted strings with leading whitespace first in a macro

	* src/macro.c (expand_token): Handles new token type TOKEN_SPACE.
	(expand_argument): Do.

	* src/input.c (next_token): SPACE and NUM/OTHER characters are only
	grouped together iff both quote and comment strings are single

	that are of use for other modules (shipout_int, numeric_arg,
	skip_space, bad_argc), and the macros ARG() and DECLARE().

	module brings in a builtin_table, which is pushed on a stack.
	(struct builtin_table): New struct for list of builtin_tables.
	(m4_loadmodule): New function to implement builtin "loadmodule".
	(shipout_int): No longer static, to be used by modules.

	(skip_space): do.
	(bad_argc): do.
	(builtin_init): changed to call install_builtin_table()
	(find_builtin_by_name): Now searches all builtin_tables

	in path.c.

	* src/m4.c (main): Added call to module_init().

	* modules: New directory with a few demo modules.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added modules/* since modules/ is not
	in SUBDIRS.

	* configure.in: Added modules/Makefile to AC_OUTPUT.

	* configure.in: Added code to implement --with-modules.  Tests for
	<dlfcn.h> and -ldl.

	* acconfig.h: Added WITH_MODULES

1998-10-02  Ren Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* examples/Makefile.am (pkgdata_DATA): Removed special target for
	check and variables TESTS.  These tests are now run from the
	tests/ directory.

	* tests/Makefile.am (OTHER_TESTS): Added tests from the example/
	directory.  The files stay there but the tests are run from the
	tests/ directory.

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added run-test.

	* tests/run-test: New file.  Run a test manually

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/get_them: Moved automatically generated
	tests (from the manual) to sub directory tests/gentest/.  The
	tests/ directory had gotten a bit messy.

1998-09-06  Erick Branderhorst  <Erick.Branderhorst@asml.nl>

	* examples/{comments,ddivert,debug,iso8859,reverse,sysv-args,\
	wrap}.test: Added a few testcases.

1998-08-21  Erick Branderhorst  <Erick.Branderhorst@asml.nl>

	* Prerelease 1.4h.

	* lib/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): regex.h added

	* configure.in (jm_WITH_REGEX, jm_PREREQ_ERROR):

	* acm4/Makefile.am: created providing rules to create
	$(top_srcdir)/acinclude.m4 to be used by aclocal.

	* tests/defs (LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LANG): force them to be
	`C'. Reported by Ulrich Drepper.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Removed checks directory
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Removed checks/Makefile

	* doc/m4.texinfo (Patsubst,example): @comment added to preserve
	the space when m4.texinfo is edited and whitespace.el is active.
	(Defn,example): idem.

1998-08-20  Erick Branderhorst  <Erick.Branderhorst@asml.nl>

	* doc/m4.texinfo (Esyscmd): grep ../Makefile instead of
	../COPYING. ../Makefile is a file which is certainly present when
	test is executed in testSubDir. One can't be sure that the COPYING
	file is in .. or ../.. in all situations, the ../Makefile is
	always there.

	* doc/m4.texinfo (Include): adjusted expected test output
	according to new tests, i.e. the input will always come from the
	file `in' created by the test.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Added three lines at the top to get
	esyscmd.1.test working.

	* tests/get-them: modified to generate clearer tests who will need
	less maintenance when new test examples are created in
	`doc/m4.texinfo'. All tests are small (nearly stand-alone, they
	need the generic file `defs') shell scripts creating `in', `ok',
	`out' and when apropriate `okerr' and `err' in the directory
	`testSubDir' when executed. The compare of `ok' and `out'
	(and of `okerr' and `err') will be the exit status of the test.
	`out' must match `ok' (and `okerr' must match `err') for the test
	to be succesful.

	* tests/[a-b]\{1,8\}.[0-9]+.test: This namespace is reserved for
	the tests generated by tests/get-them getting it input normally
	from doc/m4.texinfo. The namespace tests/[a-b]+[0-9]+.test (no `.'
	(dot) before the numeric part) is reserved for all other (hand
	written) tests. The `+' means one or more times.

1998-08-12  Erick Branderhorst  <Erick.Branderhorst@asml.nl>

	* doc/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): helptoman.pl and $(MANS) to
	supported short man page to refer to info documentation

	read according to this table.

1998-08-09  Ren Seindal  <rene@seindal.dk>

	* src/numb.{c,h}: New files, implements multiple precision eval

	Have $(OBJECTS) depend on $(ANSI2KNR), so to trigger compilation
	of ansi2knr whenever it is needed.
	* configure.in: Adjusted for correct STACKOVF substitution.

	* src/builtin.c (builtin_init): Merge in functionality from
	previous prefix_all_buitins function, while making entries in the
	symbol table, but not modifying the builtin description itself.

	* src/freeze.c (reload_frozen_state): Add a useless `break;',
	because *many* compilers do not accept an empty `default:'.

	* builtin.c (DECLARE): Simplify by using _ ().

	* freeze.c: New file.
	* Makefile.in: Compile it, distribute it.
	* m4.c: Recognize, document and process --freeze-state (-F) and

	* stackovf.c (setup_stackovf_trap): Replace "Don't" by "Do not" in
	error message, for when no code possibility exists.  Even if this
	line is completely #ifdef'ed out, it brings a syntax error.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab, Jim Meyering and Joseph E. Sacco.

	* Makefile.in (install): Have install depend on all too, for lib
	to be remade as needed.

	* examples/stackovf.sh: Try ksh, bsh and bash for shells

1994-07-12  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in (check): Have it depend on all instead of m4.  In
	this way, a change in lib will be detected and processed.

	* builtin.c (numeric_arg): Use strtol and verify the conversion,
	instead of using sscanf which stops as soon as there is a
	non-digit in the input.  Previously, incr(1xyzzy), eval(1,2xyzzy)
	and divert(1xyzzy) were all accepted without any warning or error
	messages.
	* m4.h: Declare strtol as long if not including stdlib.h.
	* configure.in: Check for limits.h, and replace strtol if missing.

	adding support for SunOS/BSD (sigvec, sigstack, and 4-parameter signal
	handlers), and a default error message if the fault address is not
	available (when neither siginfo.h nor BSD sigcontext are supported).
	* configure.in: Changes for stackovf.h: Check for sigcontext,
	sigaction, sigstack, and define rlim_t as int if necessary.
	* acconfig.h: Added HAVE_SIGCONTEXT and rlim_t.
	* examples/stackovf.sh: Run m4 -L99999999 to allow stack overflow.

1994-07-02  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Remove dependency of USE_STACKOVF on STDC_HEADERS,
	because siginfo.h is unrelated to standard headers, and siginfo.h
	is already checked for.
	Reported by Joseph E. Sacco.

	* acconfig.h, aclocal.m4, m4.h: Replace HAVE_PROTOTYPES by
	PROTOTYPES.
	* aclocal.m4, configure.in: Replace AC_HAVE_PROTOTYPES by
	AC_PROTOTYPES.

1994-06-29  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* builtin.c (substitute): Use \& to represent this part of the
	string which was matched by the whole regexp, instead of
	representing the whole string.  Any usage of \0 issues a warning
	and acts like \&, it will disappear in some subsequent release.

1994-06-27  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* m4.c: Complete prototype for forwarded declaration of usage.

	* input.c (init_macro_token): Correct own reference in error
	message.  Previous name get_macro_func was referred to instead.
	(next_char):  Correct own reference in error message.  Previous
	name advance_input was referred to instead.

	* m4.h: Declare eval_t and unsigned_eval_t typedefs to 32 bits.
	* eval.c (logical_or_term, logical_and_term, or_term, xor_term,
	and_term, not_term, logical_not_term, cmp_term, shift_term,
	add_term, mult_term, exp_term, unary_term, simple_term): Add
	prototype to forwarded declarations.  Declare parameter v1 as
	eval_t * instead of int *.  Same for local variable v2 in dyadic
	functions.  Same for result in exp_term.
	* builtin.c (m4_eval): Declare value as eval_t instead of int.
	(ntoa): Declare value as eval_t instead of int.  Declare uvalue as

	* macro.c: Complete the prototypes of forwarded expand_macro and
	expand_token.

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Distribute ansi2knr.1

	* Makefile.in (stamp-h.in): Avoid running ./config.status if
	stamp-h does not exist yet.  This avoids running it a second time
	just after the initial ./configure.
	Reported by David MacKenzie and Tom McConnell.

	* m4.h: Replace the enum debug_info declaration with a series of
	#define's.  The Ultrix 3.1 compiler would otherwise need casting
	(int) to most references, when used in expressions.
	Reported by Tom McConnell.

1994-06-25  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* aclocal.m4: Replace FP_PROTOTYPES by AC_HAVE_PROTOTYPES,
	following an idea from Brook G. Milligan.  AC_HAVE_PROTOTYPES
	calls the compiler.  Previously, FP_PROTOTYPES was only calling
	the preprocessor; by not being subject to CFLAGS, this was
	discouraging those flags asking for ANSI compilation.
	* acconfig.h: Document HAVE_PROTOTYPES.
	* configure.in: Use AC_HAVE_PROTOTYPES instead of FP_PROTOTYPES.
	* m4.h: Define _() according to HAVE_PROTOTYPES, not __STDC__.
	Reported by Eric Backus.

	* configure.in: Substitute CFLAGS and LDFLAGS, taking their value
	from the environment.  Default CFLAGS to -g if not set.
	* Makefile.in: Have CFLAGS and LDFLAGS substituted from configure.
	* lib/Makefile.in: Have CFLAGS substituted from configure.
	Reported by Eric Backus and Tom McConnell.

	* configure.in: m4_undefine changeword before using AC_ENABLE.

	* m4.h: Declare prototypes for error (for ANSI compilers only),
	prefix_all_builtins and reference_error.
	Reported by Tom McConnell.

	* input.c (set_word_regexp): Do not try to initialize the array
	test from a string, this does not work with non-ANSI compilers.
	Reported by Eric Backus.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Clean examples/ before saving it.
	(distclean-local): Also remove stamp-h.
	Reported by Eric Backus.

	* Makefile.in (_stackovf.c): Goal for compiling stacokovf.c with
	non ANSI compilers.
	Reported by Tom McConnell.

	* checks/Makefile.in (clean): Depends on mostlyclean.
	(mostlyclean): New goal.

	Declare TOKEN_DATA_FUNC macro.
	* builtin.c: Declare changeword.

	(input_init): Initialize the word regexp.
	(set_word_regexp): New.
	(next_token): Declare local variables, use the previous code if
	default_word_regexp is true.  Else, match using a new code.  Save
	the original text.
	* macro.c (expand_token): Ship out original text if not a macro
	name.
	Reported by Krste Asanovic and Pete Chown.

	[These modifs all depend upon ENABLE_CHANGEWORD]
	* m4.h: Declare external user_word_regexp.
	* m4.c: Declare user_word_regexp, and initialize it from
	--word-regexp or -W, or NULL if not specified.
	* input.c: Use user_word_regexp if specified, instead of
	DEFAULT_WORD_REGEXP.

	* Makefile.in (m4): Revert Jan 3 1994 change.  I'm unable to
	agree with it.

	* Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in: Limit suffixes to .c and .o.
	* checks/Makefile.in: Empty the suffix list.
	Reported by Geoff Russell, Joel Sherrill and Roland McGrath.

	* m4.c: Declare nesting_limit and initialize it to 250.
	Implement -LNUMBER or --nesting-limit=NUMBER to change its
	value.

	* macro.c (expand_macro): Stop execution whenever nesting limit
	is exceeded.
	Reported by Bengt Mertensson.

	* eval.c (evaluate): Diagnose excess characters in eval input.
	Things like `eval(08)' used to return 0 with no diagnostic.

	* m4.h: Capitalize first letter of all macro arguments in
	definitions.

	* m4.c: Declare warning_status, initialize it to 0.  Add new
	option -E, or --fatal-warnings, which sets warning_status to
	EXIT_FAILURE instead.
	* m4.h: Declare external warning_status.  Define EXIT_SUCCESS and
	EXIT_FAILURE if not otherwise done by header files.
	* m4.c: Delete declarations for EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE.
	* m4.c, input.c, output.c, symtab.c, builtin.c, macro.c, debug.c,
	eval.c: Replace 0 by warning_status and 1 by EXIT_FAILURE in first
	argument of all M4ERROR calls.
	Reported by Noah Friedman.

	* examples/incl-test.m4: Renamed from incl_test.m4.
	* examples/include.m4: Include incl-test.m4 instead of
	incl_test.m4.
	* examples/multiquotes.m4: Renamed from multi-quotes.m.

1994-06-22  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Avoid USE_STACKOVF if <siginfo.h> not found.  Note
	that Jim developped stackovf.c on a 486 running SVR4.0 (ESIX), and
	also tested it on a Sun Sparc workstation running SunOS 4.x.

	* format.c (format): When not HAVE_EFGCVT, m4 was failing the
	49.format check, abusing a `union values' argument with sprintf
	without selecting the proper field.  Now, save the formatting type
	first, delaying the fetch of the corresponding argument.
	Reported by Joseph E. Sacco and Tom Quinn.

	* format.c (format): Remove const from char *fmt declaration when
	not HAVE_EFGCVT, because a NUL may be forced into it.

	* m4.h: Declare atof() when not STDC_HEADERS.
	Reported by Joseph E. Sacco.

	* Regenerate configure using Autoconf 1.11, this corrects a
	problem about an incorrect cpp seting on NeXT 3.1.

1994-04-22  Jim Avera <jima@netcom.com>

	* stackovf.c: New file implementing stack-overflow detection.
	* configure.in: Check for getrlimit, sigaction.  If all of
	standard headers, getrlimit and sigaction, define USE_STACKOVF and
	substitute ${U}stackovf.o for STACKOVF.
	* acconfig.h: Declare USE_STACKOVF.
	* Makefile.in: Distribute stackovf.c, link with $(STACKOVF).
	* m4.h: Declare setup_stackovf_trap().

	warning from gcc about `repl' possibly used before defined.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	inclusion of system files, because they may define it first.

1994-01-04  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* checks/Makefile.in (CHECKS): Add a useless `*' before `[', to
	get around a problem with Alpha make seeing a syntax error, there.
	Reported by Vern Paxson.

1994-01-03  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Do not define LDFLAGS, use CFLAGS on link calls.
	Reported by Richard Stallman.

1993-12-25  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Correct test for strerror, AC_FUNC_CHECK was used

	* m4.c: Initialize show_help and show_version to zero.

	* m4.c: Ensure EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE are defined.
	Use them in exit() and usage() calls.

1993-11-27  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* m4.h: Delete extern sys_nerr, sys_errlist declarations, and
	syserr() macro.  Delete errref, add reference_error and M4ERROR.
	* m4.c: Replace errref, which was returning an input reference
	string, with reference_error, which prints it on standard error.
	* builtin.c, output.c: Use errno as second parameter to error,
	instead of using syserr() with %s.
	* *.c: Use M4ERROR instead of error: no more errref() with %s.
	Doing so, the program name appears after the input reference
	instead of before, which eases M-x next-error processing.

1993-11-24  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* checks/get-them: Escape braces with backslashes in patterns,
	because HPUX-9.01 awk needs this.

	* builtin.c (m4_eval): Cast strlen to (int) before comparing.

	* input.c (input_init): Initialize quote and comment strings
	explicitely instead of calling set_quotes and set_comment: by

	* checks/check-them: Reverse arguments to both diff, so the
	expected is on the left and the obtained on the right.

	* m4.h: Add MESSAGE{,1,2}, WARNING1, FATAL{,1} and INTERNAL_ERROR
	macros. Delete declarations for m4error, warning, fatal and

	this is not needed anymore.

	* m4.h: Declare extern FILE *debug.  Add DEBUG_PRINT{1,3} and
	DEBUG_MESSAGE{,1,2} macros.  Delete declarations for debug_print
	and debug_message, add declaration for debug_message_prefix.

	Delete debug_print and debug_message routines, add
	debug_message_prefix routine.

	Reported by Joel Sherrill.

	* builtin.c (prefix_all_builtins): Instead of the table size, use
	the null entry at end for stopping the loop.  It was overwritten.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab and Jim Meyering.

	Reported by Karl Berry.

1993-01-15  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

1992-12-19  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Release 1.0.3
	This is still a	beta release for the future GNU m4 version 1.1.

	* lib/alloca.c: New, from elsewhere.
	* lib/Makefile.in: Distribute it.  Define and use $(ALLOCA).

	* m4.h: Do not define index/rindex if already defined.  If
	FALSE/TRUE are already defined, do not redefine them, but merely
	define boolean typedef to int.

	* Makefile.in: Use $(DEFS) while compiling ansi2knr.
	* ansi2knr.c: Rewrite #ifdef HAVE_STRING_H || STDC_HEADERS,
	because some C compilers do not like connectives with #ifdef.
	* m4.h: Define `volatile' only if __GNUC__, instead of once for
	__GNUC__ and once for __STDC__.
	* lib/regex.h: Leave const alone, AC_CONST will take care of it.

	* checks/Makefile.in: Use .all_stamp instead of $(CHECKS) for
	Makefile dependencies.  Without it, make keeps destroying and
	remaking $(CHECKS) in a loop (why?).  Distribute .all_stamp.

	* m4.h, m4.c, builtin.c, output.c: Change all divertion/DIVERTION
	to diversion/DIVERSION, this was a spelling error.

	* m4.c: Declare version[], remove #include "version.h".
	* version.h: Deleted.
	* Makefile.in: Remove references to version.h.

	* output.c (shipout_text): Centralize all `#line NUM ["FILE"]'
	production, by using a simpler and more robust algorithm.  This
	solves the problem of synclines sometimes written in the middle of
	an output line.  Delete sync_line() and output_lines variable.
	* m4.h: Remove sync_line prototype and output_lines declaration.
	* input.c (next_char), output.c (shipout_text): Remove references
	to output_lines.
	* input.c (push_file, pop_file): Merely put the value -1 in
	output_current_line instead of calling sync_line, for delaying a
	single `#line NUM FILE' before next output line.  Do not test
	for sync_output, because this is unnecessary clutter.
	* output.c (make_divertion, insert_divertion): Idem.
	* input.c: Rename must_advance_line to start_of_input_line, for
	consistency.

	* debug.c (trace_header): Select a new debug line format, which
	better complies with GNU standards for formatting error messages.
	With option `-dfl', M-x next-error might be used on the output.
	* m4.c (vmesg): Adjust format of error output to GNU standards.
	* m4.texinfo: Adjust examples for `make check' to work.

	* m4.h, builtin.c, debug.c, input.c, macro.c, path.c: Use upper
	case for enum debug_info constants, which were all lower case.

	* builtin.c (m4_regexp, m4_patsubst): Use re_search instead of
	re_search_2.
	* lib/regex.[ch]: Use new version from textutils 1.3.6, with some
	collected patches.  I tried a few times using newer regex.[ch], it
	mysteriously stopped aborting with this one.  Insecure feeling...
	* lib/Makefile.in: Distribute regex.[ch].old, just in case!

1992-12-18  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* m4.c: Change `--no-warnings' to `--silent'.
	Reported by David MacKenzie.

	* m4.c: Put all M4OPTS code upon IMPLEMENT_M4OPTS control, and
	leave it off for now.  See comment in m4.c for justification.
	Reported by David MacKenzie.

	* configure.in: Replace AC_USG by AC_HAVE_HEADERS(string.h).
	* m4.h, ansi2knr.c, lib/regex.h: Replace USG by HAVE_STRING_H.

	* Makefile.in: Add a new `info' goal.  Use macro MAKEINFO.

	* Makefile.in: Ensure recursive cleaning is done before local
	cleaning for all clean goals.

	* builtin.c (ntoa): Ensure the value is always interpreted as a
	signed quantity, whatever the radix is.

1992-11-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@idefix>

	* builtin.c, format.c, input.c: Split long lines.
	* m4.c: Use typedef macro_definition instead of struct
	macro_definition.
	* symtab.c: Use typedef symbol instead of struct symbol.

1992-11-17  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* *.[ch]: Remove all trailing whitespace, in code and comments.

	* configure.in: Find some awk.
	* Makefile.in: Add $(AWK) to MDEFINES.
	* checks/Makefile.in: Transmit $(AWK) to get_them.
	* checks/get_them: Use $AWK instead of gawk.  Add a close in the
	awk script when switching files, because without this, mawk runs
	out of file descriptors.

1992-11-16  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in (realclean): Delete m4.info*.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	* Makefile.in: Adjust and link with checks/Makefile.
	* checks/Makefile.in: New.
	* configure.in: Output checks/Makefile.

	* checks/get_them: Have the dnl header of each test more
	recognizable by next-error, also use a better message.

1992-11-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@idefix>

	* m4.h [__GNUC__]: Use __volatile__ instead of `volatile.'
	And use that only if __GNUC__ since we're using it's GCC-specific
	semantics that tell the compiler the associated function doesn't
	return.

	* builtin.c (substitute): Don't use character as an array index.
	(dumpdef_cmp): Make formal arguments `const void *' to avoid
	warnings with gcc -W -Wall on systems with qsort prototype.
	(m4_errprint): Cast obstack_finish to `char *' to avoid warnings
	from gcc -W -Wall.

	* eval.c (most functions): Add parentheses to assignments used
	as truth values go avoid warnings from gcc -Wall.

	* input.c, m4.c, output.c, path.c, symtab.c: Declare static
	any functions that don't need external scope.

	* builtin.c, debug.c, format.c, m4.c, m4.h, macro.c, symtab.c
	(many functions and arrays): Declare `const'.

1992-11-15  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* *.[ch]: Rename nil to NULL, using the declaration from <stdio.h>,
	removing the declaration from m4.h.  Also rename false to FALSE
	and true to TRUE.

	* lib/Makefile.in (Makefile): New goal.

	* Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in: Add a .c.o rule, so CFLAGS is not
	so heavily loaded.  It gets more easily overridable, calling make.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Get .fname from the current directory name,
	instead of from version.h.  I need updating many files manually,
	when the version changes, version.h is just one of them.

1992-11-14  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* m4.h: Remove the tag `boolean' on the enum introducing typedef
	`boolean'.  This tag conflicts with <sys/types.h> on SVR4.
	Reported by Tom McConnell.

1992-11-13  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* m4.texinfo: Correct the examples for 33.divert, 38.divnum,
	39.cleardiv, which were describing missing or spurious newlines.
	Modify examples 52.eval, 53.esyscmd and 54.sysval so the results
	do not depend on machine word size, `/bin/false' implementation,
	or `wc' output format.  `make check' is more dependable, now.

	* checks/check_them: Summarize the failed tests by listing their
	name, at end.  If none, issue `All checks successful'.  Output
	`Checking' instead of `Input file:'.

	* checks/get_them, checks/check_them: Reindented.

	* Makefile.in (dist): chmod a+r before making the tar file.

1992-11-12  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* builtin.c (m4_dnl): Diagnose any parameter to `dnl'.

	* input.c (next_token): Reinitialize token_buttom just after using
	it as a watermark with obstack_free.  Or else, a future token, big
	enough for triggering reallocation of the obstack chunk, could
	void the initialized value of token_buttom, later causing panic in
	obstack_free.  Rename token_buttom to token_bottom everywhere.

	* m4.h: Before declaring errno, first include <errno.h> and
	ensure that it does not define errno.
	Reported by Richard Stallman.

1992-11-11  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* builtin.c: Define and use DECLARE macro for builtins.

	* builtin.c (m4_ifelse): Avoid any diagnostic when exactly one
	argument, this is a common idiom for introducing long comments.

	* builtin.c (m4_ifelse): If 3n + 2 arguments, diagnose missing
	arguments.  The last argument was silently ignored.

	* m4.c (cmd_error): Add a missing semicolon before va_end().

1992-11-10  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Now handle protoized sources.  Define and use U.

	* configure.in: Define U through FP_PROTOTYPES for old compilers.
	Add AC_ISC_POSIX, AC_CONST, AC_SIZE_T.
	* aclocal.m4: New, provide FP_PROTOTYPES.
	* m4.h: Conditionnaly protoized through Args, save for varags.
	* builtin.c: Protoized.  Then:
	Include <sys/types.h> if size_t is not defined, before "regex.h".
	(m4_ifelse): Fetch built-in name properly for diagnostic.
	(m4_dumpdef): Remove wrong (char *) cast calling dump_symbol.
	(m4_regexp): Add const to `msg' declaration.

	(xfree): Accept void * instead of char *.
	(xmalloc): Return void * instead of char *.
	(xrealloc): Accept and return void * instead of char *.
	* macro.c: Protoized.
	* output.c: Protoized.
	* path.c: Protoized.  Then cast some (char *) over xmalloc's.
	* symtab.c: Protoized.

	* m4.texinfo: Remove directory from diagnostics in 30.include,
	51.eval, 56.errprint and 57.m4exit tests.

	cause more conflicting trouble than they make good.

	* configure.in: Avoid configuration header file.  Add some tests.
	* m4.h: Remove #include "config.h".
	* Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in: Implement Autoconf interface.
	Then, rewritten for better compliance with GNU standards.

1992-11-05  Franois Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* format.c (format): Avoid syntax error if not HAVE_EFGCVT,
